## User Stories
* Application will take person’s age in years and convert it into seconds.
* Application will take two dates and determine the difference, in seconds, between the two. (This way a user can enter a birthdate and the application can compare the birthdate against the current time to come up with an accurate age.)
* Application will return the age of a human in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
* Return the age of a human in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
* Application will return the age of a human in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
* Application will return the age of a human in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
* Application will determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet… (yikes!) To do this, the application will have to calculate the user’s life expectancy. (Note that life expectancy varies from country to country and depending on various demographics.)
 * If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, application will account for (and test) this possible outcome as well.
